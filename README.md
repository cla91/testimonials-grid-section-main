## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's my first time using SASS, so I just tried a cuple of things to understand how they worked. The CSS looks a bit messy with all the :nth-child(), maybe I should have used more classes.
